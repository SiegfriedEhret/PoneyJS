# PoneyJS

## What is it ?

PoneyJS is the only functionnal library you'll need for your JavaScript application. With an API designed by the elders of PoneyWorld, you will be stuned by the power it will give to your code.

This is an alpha release of the library. Thus, we need you too improve it and to make it the most powerful functional library the world has ever seen.

## API

* Map
`PoneyJS.walkThroughRainbows(array, function (value) { /* Do whatever you want with your value here */})`

* Filter
`PoneyJS.keepTheRainAway(array, function (value) { /* Tell the poney if the value must survive */ })`

* Get the first value of results from a filter
`PoneyJS.getAUnicorn(array, function (value) { /* Tell the poney if the value must survive. There will remain only one */ })`

* Reduce
`PoneyJS.makeALittlePoney(array, function (acc, value) { /* Do whatever you want with your ponies */}, initial)`

* console.log
`PoneyJS.fromYourPoney(message)`

* Check if a value is truthy or falsy
`PoneyJS.areUnicornsReal(value)`

* Throw an error
`PoneyJS.messageFromSatan(error)`
